## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB (Local or Atlas connection string)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sameerredy213/campus-gate-pass.git
cd campus-gate-pass
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/campus-gate-pass
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
# Add other keys as needed
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the client directory, and install dependencies.

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 4. Seed Database (First Run Only)
To create the initial "Dev Admin" account:
```bash
# In a separate terminal, while server is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/system/seed
# OR simply visit http://localhost:5000/api/system/seed in your browser
```

### 5. Run the Application
You can run both client and server concurrently from the root:
```bash
# From root directory
npm run dev
```
